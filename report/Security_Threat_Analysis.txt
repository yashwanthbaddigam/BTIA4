# Supply Chain Blockchain Network (ICT4415)

## Overview
This repository contains a minimal Hyperledger Fabric test network and chaincode to simulate a supply chain with three organizations:
- Manufacturer
- Distributor
- Retailer

Chaincode implements shipment creation, transfer, and receipt, and supports querying shipment state.

---

## Files / Structure
See the included file tree. Key items:
- `network/` — network configs, scripts to generate crypto & start network
- `chaincode/shipment/` — Go chaincode
- `application/` — simple Node.js client to submit transactions
- `report/` — security analysis

---

## Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Hyperledger Fabric binaries (`cryptogen`, `configtxgen`, `peer`) in PATH — see Fabric docs
- Go (1.16+) for building chaincode
- Node.js (12+) & npm for the application

---

## Quick start (development)
1. Generate crypto material and start network:
   ```bash
   cd network
   ./scripts/startNetwork.sh
